# DecoderRing
Projects like this one, builds your skills to work with Mocha and Chai. I wrote a series of 
unit tests that uses the expect() method to test my code. 

This project includes three files that decodes in three different ways that include:
-The Caesar shift
-The Polybius square
-The Substitution cipher

All three files has their own test file as well, and that is where Mocha and Chai come into play.
